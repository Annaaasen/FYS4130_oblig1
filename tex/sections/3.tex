    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Determine the phases of the system, and give  quantitative details such as the concentretion of rods with different orientations. 
        \item Are there phase transitions? If so, find the critical concentrations (or pressures). Which quantities, if any, are undergoing discontinuous changes?
        \item Are there coexistence of phases? If so, which phases are coexisting?
        \item As a summary, explain briefly in words what is happening to the system as the condidtions are changed.
    \end{enumerate}
